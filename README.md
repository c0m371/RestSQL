RestSQL is a lightweight, high-performance SQL Query to REST API Generator built on C# and .NET. It allows developers to define dynamic, secure, and fully-featured API endpoints using simple YAML configuration files. RestSQL acts as a secure proxy, executing user-defined SQL queries and automatically transforming the flat result sets into complex, nested JSON structures, eliminating the need to write repetitive backend code for data access. It supports multiple database types (starting with PostgreSQL) via a unified configuration.
